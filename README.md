# Autism Ontario App

This repository holds the Flutter/Dart code for an iOS/Android app that exposes the advanced search functionality on the Autism Ontario website. 

Search results include service listings, events and webinars. 

The app is geo-aware and provides the ability to search for nearby service listings and to click to display them in the device's map service (eg Google Maps). It also includes click to call links for phone numbers that bring up the device's default dialer, and click to bring up links in the default browser to register for an event or to view webinar content.

The app communicates with a Drupal/CiviCRM/Apache Solr backend via GraphQL.

Autism Ontario is the publisher.
